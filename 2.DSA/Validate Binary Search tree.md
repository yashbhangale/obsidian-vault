Question : given BT and determine if it's a BST.

in binary search tree all node in let is smaller that nodes on right


- A **binary search tree** is a data structure where each node has at most two children (left and right).

- Each node represents a value, and all values in the left subtree are smaller than the parent node.

3. Properties:
   - Left child: Smaller than parent
   - Right child: Larger than parent

4. Time complexity:
	- Search: O(log n)
    - Insert: O(log n)
    - Delete: O(log n) in average case
