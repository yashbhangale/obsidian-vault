## four main pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in simple terms:

### 1.**Encapsulation**:

- **What it is**: Encapsulation is like putting data and the methods (functions) that operate on that data inside a single unit, which is called a **class**. This keeps the data safe from outside interference and misuse.
- **Why it’s useful**: It allows you to control how the data is accessed and modified. You can make certain data private and only accessible through methods, which provides security and avoids unwanted changes.
- **Example**: Imagine you have a class `Car`. It contains data like `speed` and methods like `drive()` and `stop()`. You can make the `speed` private so it can only be changed by using a specific method like `setSpeed()`. This way, you can control how the speed is modified.

```java
class Car {
    private int speed; // private variable

    public void setSpeed(int speed) {
        if (speed > 0) {
            this.speed = speed; // control how speed is set
        }
    }

    public int getSpeed() {
        return speed; // getter method to access speed
    }
}

```

Here, `speed` is encapsulated (hidden) inside the `Car` class and can only be accessed through `setSpeed()` and `getSpeed()` methods. This is **encapsulation**.

### 2. **Inheritance**:

- **What it is**: Inheritance is when one class takes on the properties and methods of another class. The class that gives its properties is called the **parent** (or base class), and the class that inherits is called the **child** (or derived class).
- **Why it’s useful**: It helps in **code re-usability**. If multiple classes share similar features, you can put the shared features in a parent class and the child classes can reuse them. Plus, child classes can also add their own features.
- **Example**: Let’s say we have a `Vehicle` class with common properties like `speed` and methods like `drive()`. We can create specific classes like `Car` and `Bike` that inherit these properties from `Vehicle`.

```java
class Vehicle {
    int speed;

    public void drive() {
        System.out.println("Vehicle is driving");
    }
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
    public void honk() {
        System.out.println("Car is honking");
    }
}

```

In this example, the `Car` class inherits the `drive()` method from `Vehicle`. This means `Car` objects can use both `drive()` and their own `honk()` method.

### 3. **Polymorphism**:

- **What it is**: Polymorphism allows one name to have many forms. In OOP, this means you can use the same method or function name to perform different tasks, based on the context.
    
- **Why it’s useful**: It makes code flexible and reusable. A method can behave differently based on the input or the object that calls it. There are two main types:
    
    - **Compile-time Polymorphism (Method Overloading)**: When you have multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.
    - **Run-time Polymorphism (Method Overriding)**: When a child class has a method with the same name as one in the parent class but gives it a new implementation.

**Example of Method Overloading (Compile-time Polymorphism)**:

```java
class Calculator {
    public int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    public double add(double a, double b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}

```

Here, the `add()` method is **overloaded**: one version takes two integers, and the other takes two doubles.

**Example of Method Overriding (Run-time Polymorphism)**:

```java
class Animal {
    public void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    public void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

```
In this case, `Dog` **overrides** the `sound()` method of `Animal`. Even though the method name is the same, the behavior is different.

### 4. **Abstraction**:

- **What it is**: Abstraction means showing only the essential details and hiding the complexity. You focus on what an object does, not how it does it.
- **Why it’s useful**: It helps reduce complexity by allowing you to focus on the high-level functioning of your program without worrying about the details.
- **Example**: You know how to drive a car (you use methods like `accelerate()` and `brake()`), but you don’t need to know exactly how the engine works.

In Java, abstraction is usually implemented using:

- **Abstract classes**: Classes that can have both defined methods (with code) and undefined methods (without code).
- **Interfaces**: They contain only method signatures, and any class that implements the interface must provide its own implementation for those methods. 
- **Example of Abstraction with an Interface**:
```java

interface Animal {
    void sound(); // method signature without implementation
}

class Dog implements Animal {
    public void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

```

Here, `Animal` is an interface that defines what a sound method should look like. The `Dog` class implements this interface and provides its own behavior.

### Quick Recap:

1. **Encapsulation**: Hides data and gives controlled access.
2. **Inheritance**: Allows a class to use the properties and methods of another class.
3. **Polymorphism**: One name, many forms (method overloading and overriding).
4. **Abstraction**: Hides unnecessary details and shows only the essential parts.
