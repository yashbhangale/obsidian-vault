git all permissions to perticular dir

```
sudo chmod 777 .... .... .... ....
```



### 1. **To Check File Size**

Use the `ls -lh` command for a human-readable file size:

```bash
ls -lh
```

- `-l`: Long listing format
- `-h`: Human-readable sizes (e.g., KB, MB, GB)

Output Example:

```
-rw-r--r--  1 user user  4.0K Jan  3 12:00 example.txt
```

Here, `4.0K` is the size of the file.

### 2. **To Check Directory Size**

Use the `du` (disk usage) command:

```bash
du -sh [directory_name]
```

- `-s`: Summary of the total size
- `-h`: Human-readable format

Example:

```bash
du -sh /home/user
```

Output:

```
2.1G    /home/user
```

This shows the total size of the directory.

### 3. **To See Sizes of All Files and Subdirectories**

To list sizes of all files and subdirectories in a directory:

```bash
du -h [directory_name]
```

---

### 4. **Sort Files by Size**

Use `ls` with the `-S` flag to sort files by size:

```bash
ls -lSh
```

- `-S`: Sort by file size (largest first)
- `-h`: Human-readable

---

### 5. **Check Free Disk Space**

To see free and used disk space:

```bash
df -h
```

- `df`: Disk space usage
- `-h`: Human-readable format

Example Output:

```
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/sda1       50G   20G   30G  40% /
```
