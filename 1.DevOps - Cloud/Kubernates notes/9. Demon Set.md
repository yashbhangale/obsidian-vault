title: Kubernates notes 9  Demon Set

In Kubernetes, a **DaemonSet** is a type of workload resource that ensures a copy of a specific pod runs on all (or a subset of) nodes in a cluster. DaemonSets are typically used for system-level or background services that need to run on every node, such as log collectors, monitoring agents, or network proxies.

### Key Characteristics of DaemonSet:

1. **Pod Distribution**: Ensures that a pod is running on all nodes, or a specific subset of nodes, based on labels or taints.
2. **Automatic Pod Management**: When new nodes are added to the cluster, the DaemonSet automatically schedules the pod on the new nodes.
3. **Scaling**: Does not scale in the same way as Deployments or StatefulSets, since its purpose is to run one pod per node, not to scale the number of pods per node.

### Use Cases:

- **Monitoring agents**: Tools like Prometheus node exporters or Fluentd that need to run on each node.
- **Log collection**: Running agents like Filebeat or Fluentd on each node to collect logs.
- **Network proxies**: DaemonSets can be used for network-related tasks, like a CNI plugin or service mesh proxy.

### Example:

Here's a simple example of a DaemonSet YAML:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  name: my-daemonset
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      name: my-daemonset
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        name: my-daemonset
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: my-container
        image: my-image:latest
```

This DaemonSet ensures that a pod with the container `my-image:latest` runs on every node in the cluster.
