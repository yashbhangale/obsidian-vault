	- Distributed tracing, metrics, and logs are the **three pillars of observability**
- help us understand, debug, and optimize modern distributed systems.


## 1. **Distributed Tracing**

### Concept:

- Distributed tracing is a ==method used to track the flow of a single request== or transaction across different services or components in a distributed system.
- It helps you see how a request moves through the system, which services it interacts with, and how long each step takes.

### How It Works:

- Each request is assigned a ==unique **trace ID**==.
- As the request moves through services, ==**span IDs**== are generated for each service call or operation.
- The trace ID ties all spans together to represent the complete request flow.

### Key Terminology:

- **Trace**: Represents the entire lifecycle of a request.
- **Span**: ==A single operation or unit of work within a trace==. Each span includes details like start time, end time, and metadata.
- **Parent-Child Relationships**: Spans can have parent-child relationships to show dependencies (e.g., Service A → Service B → Service C).

### Benefits:

- Identifies bottlenecks by showing which service or operation is slowing down the request.
- Helps visualize dependencies between services.
- Useful for debugging errors in complex, distributed architectures.

## 2. **Metrics**

### Concept:

- Metrics are numerical data points that represent the state or performance of your system over time.
- They are quantitative and can be aggregated to provide insights into system health.

### Common Metrics Types:

1. **Infrastructure Metrics**:
    - CPU usage, memory consumption, disk I/O, network traffic.
2. **Application Metrics**:
    - Request rates (RPS), response times (latency), error rates.
3. **Business Metrics**:
    - User sign-ups, transactions per second, revenue per hour.

### Characteristics:

- Metrics are time-series data: They are tracked over time, enabling trend analysis.
- Metrics are typically **predefined** and emitted at regular intervals (e.g., every second or minute).

### Use Cases:

- Monitoring system performance and availability.
- Detecting anomalies, like sudden spikes in traffic or errors.
- Setting up alerts for threshold breaches (e.g., CPU > 80%).

## 3. **Logs**

### Concept:

- Logs are unstructured or semi-structured text-based records generated by applications or systems to describe specific events or states.
- Logs are **contextual** and provide detailed information about what happened at a specific time.

### Types of Logs:

1. **Application Logs**:
    - Messages generated by the application, e.g., “User authentication failed.”
2. **System Logs**:
    - Logs from the operating system or hardware, e.g., kernel logs, systemd logs.
3. **Security Logs**:
    - Logs for auditing, e.g., failed login attempts, unauthorized access.

### Log Levels:

- **DEBUG**: Detailed information for developers.
- **INFO**: General system information (e.g., “Server started on port 8080”).
- **WARNING**: Indications of potential problems.
- **ERROR**: Errors that need attention but do not crash the system.
- **CRITICAL/FATAL**: Severe errors that may crash the application.

### Benefits:

- Helps troubleshoot issues by providing detailed context.
- Useful for auditing and compliance.
- Complements metrics and tracing for a holistic view.
