SigNoz is an open-source **observability platform** designed to help developers monitor, troubleshoot, and optimize the performance of their applications. It is a popular alternative to tools like Datadog or New Relic but with a focus on being open-source and providing full control over your monitoring setup.



SigNoz is an ==observability tool== that uses **OpenTelemetry** for collecting metrics, traces, and logs. You can:

- Monitor application performance.
- Create dashboards for insights.
- Customize alerts for specific metrics.

**Observability** is the ability to measure the internal state of a system by examining its external outputs.

Observability helps you answer:

- **What is happening inside the system?**
- **Why is it happening?**
- **How can we prevent or fix it?**

### Observability vs. Monitoring:

- **Monitoring** focuses on collecting predefined metrics to check if the system is working as expected.
- **Observability** focuses on understanding _why_ the system is behaving in a certain way by using all available data (metrics, logs, traces).

### Pillars of Observability

Observability is built on three key data types, often referred to as the **three pillars**:

1. **Metrics**:
    - Numerical measurements representing the state or performance of the system.
    - Examples: CPU usage, memory usage, request rates, latency, error rates.
    - Tools: Prometheus, SigNoz, DataDog.

2. **Logs**:
    - Textual records of events in a system.
    - Provide detailed context for specific events or errors.
    - Example: “Error: Connection refused at 12:00 UTC”.
    - Tools: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), Loki.

3. **Traces**:
    - Distributed tracing tracks the journey of a request as it flows through different services in the system.
    - Helps identify bottlenecks or failures in microservices.
    - Tools: Jaeger, OpenTelemetry, SigNoz
