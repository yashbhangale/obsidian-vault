- reduce img size
- improve performance of container

A **Docker multi-stage build** is a method for creating optimized Docker images by using multiple `FROM` statements in a single `Dockerfile`


why to use multi stage builds :   

- **Reduced Image Size**: You avoid including unnecessary build tools and dependencies in the final image.
- **Improved Security**: Only the minimal runtime environment is included, reducing the attack surface.
- **Simplified Maintenance**: No need for separate `Dockerfile`s for building and running the application.

#### **Example: Multi-Stage Build for a Go Application**
```
# Stage 1: Build
FROM golang:1.20 AS build
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN go build -o main .

# Stage 2: Runtime
FROM alpine:latest
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=build /app/main .
CMD ["./main"]
```

```
# Stage 1: Build
FROM node:18 AS build
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

# Stage 2: Runtime
FROM nginx:stable-alpine
COPY --from=build /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html
EXPOSE 80
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

### **Best Practices**

- Use minimal base images for the runtime stage (e.g., `alpine`, `debian-slim`).
- Keep the build and runtime stages separate to avoid unnecessary dependencies.
- Always pin image versions to prevent unexpected changes
