## **Learning Roadmap**

### **1. Introduction to React**

- What is React?
- Why React? Benefits and Features
- How React differs from other frameworks (e.g., Angular, Vue)
- Understanding React's Virtual DOM

### **2. Setting up the Environment**

- Installing Node.js and npm
- Setting up a React app using `create-react-app`
- Understanding the folder structure of a React project
- Running the development server

### **3. React Basics**

- JSX Syntax (JavaScript XML)
- [[React Components]]
    - Functional Components
    - Class Components (briefly understand, mostly outdated now)
- [[Props (Properties)]]
    - Passing props to components
    - Props drilling

### **4. [[State Management]]

- What is State?
- Using `useState` Hook
- Updating state and re-rendering
- Difference between Props and State

### **5. [[Event Handling]]

- Handling Events in React (e.g., `onClick`, `onChange`)
- Passing functions as props for event handling
- Binding event handlers

### **6. Conditional Rendering**

- Rendering UI conditionally using `if-else`
- Ternary operators in JSX
- Short-circuit evaluation

### **7. Lists and Keys**

- Rendering lists using `.map()`
- Importance of Keys in lists
- Dynamic list generation

### **8. Forms in React**

- Controlled Components
- Uncontrolled Components
- Handling form inputs (e.g., text, checkbox, radio)
- Form validation

### **9. React Lifecycle (Optional for Functional Components)**

- Class Components Lifecycle Methods (e.g., `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`)
- Comparison with Functional Components

### **10. React Hooks**

- Introduction to Hooks
- Commonly used hooks:
    - `useState`
    - `useEffect`
    - `useContext`
- Advanced Hooks:
    - `useReducer`
    - `useMemo`
    - `useRef`

### **11. Context API**

- What is Context?
- Creating and using a Context
- Avoiding Prop Drilling with Context API

### **12. React Router**

- Installing React Router
- Basic Routing: `BrowserRouter`, `Route`, `Link`, and `Switch`
- Dynamic Routing (`useParams`)
- Nested Routing

### **13. State Management Libraries**

- Why use state management libraries?
- Introduction to Redux (if needed)
    - Redux Core Concepts (Store, Actions, Reducers)
    - Using `Redux Toolkit` (modern approach)
- Alternative libraries: Zustand, MobX

### **14. APIs and Async Operations**

- Fetching data with `fetch` or `axios`
- Handling async operations with `useEffect`
- Displaying loading states
- Error handling

### **15. Performance Optimization**

- Code splitting with React.lazy and Suspense
- Memoization using `React.memo`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback`
- Optimizing re-renders

### **16. Testing in React**

- Unit Testing with Jest
- Testing components with React Testing Library
- Writing snapshot tests

### **17. Deployment**

- Building your React app for production
- Deploying React apps on platforms:
    - Vercel
    - Netlify
    - GitHub Pages

### **18. Advanced Topics (Optional)**

- Higher Order Components (HOCs)
- Portals in React
- Error Boundaries
- React Fragments

### **19. UI Libraries and Styling**

- Styling options in React:
    - CSS Modules
    - Styled-components
    - Tailwind CSS
- Using UI libraries like Material-UI, Ant Design, or Chakra UI

### **20. Real-World Projects**

- Build small projects to practice:
    - Todo App
    - Weather App (using OpenWeather API)
    - Blog or Notes App
    - E-commerce site (basic version)
